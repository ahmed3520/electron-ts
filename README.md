# Lame

The All-in-One App is a versatile and powerful application that allows users to perform various tasks through a single, centralized platform. Users can install and use different apps within the main app, which is powered by a chat interface (currently using ChatGPT). The supported apps can be developed in multiple programming languages, such as Node.js, Python, and others. Each app should include a binary file, a manifest JSON, a logo, and any additional assets that may be required.

## Usage

After setting up the All-in-One App, users can access the main chat interface to interact with the installed apps. To install new apps, follow the app installation process provided by each individual app.

## App Development <a id="app-development"></a>

Developers can create apps for the All-in-One App using various programming languages. Each app must follow the required app structure and include necessary files.

### App Structure <a id="app-structure"></a>

An app should include the following files:

- Binary file (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, or any other supported language)
- Manifest JSON (a JSON file containing app metadata)
- Logo (an image file for the app)
- Additional assets (if required)

### Manifest JSON <a id="manifest-json"></a>

The manifest JSON should contain relevant metadata for the app, such as:

```json
{
  "name": "App Name",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A brief description of the app",
  "main": "path/to/entry_file",
  "language": "Programming Language",
  "logo": "path/to/logo"
}
```
